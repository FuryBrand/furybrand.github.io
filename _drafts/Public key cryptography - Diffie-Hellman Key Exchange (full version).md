After World War II with most of Europe and ruins tension grew between the Soviet Union and the United States. 
It was clear that the next global superpower required the ablility to both launch and successively defend nuclear attacks from intercontinental ballistic missiles.
In North America the most vulnerable point of attack was over the North Pole.
So in 1958 a joint effort between United States and Canada was established known as NORAD or North American Aerospace Defense Command.
An important line of defense was the semi-automatic ground environment.
It was an automated system of over 100 long-destance radars scattered across North America.
They were connected to computerized radar stations that transmitted tracking data using telephone lines or radio waves all of this radar information was sped into a primary warning center bured a mile deep inside Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado.
This application of machine to machine communication allowed operators to make split-second devisions using information transmitted and processed automatically by computers.
This idea of being online was quickly adapted and advanced by universities in the following years as they understood the potential of computer networking.
The thing that makes the computer communication network special is that it puts the workers that be the team members who are geographically distributed in touch not only with one another but with the information base with which they work all the time and this is obviously going to make a tremendous difference in how we plan organize and execute almost everything of any intellectual consequence.
If we get into mode in which everything is handled electronically and your only identification is I'm going to plastic then you stick into the machinery
